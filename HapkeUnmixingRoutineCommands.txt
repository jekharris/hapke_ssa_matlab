Hapke Unmixing Routine

Matlab scripts and functions required:
	hapkeAlbedoNewHlsqcurvefit.m
	hapke_reflectanceSimple.m OR
	hapke_reflectanceLegrendeP.m

Data/Inputs required:
	X = wavelengths used
	Rc = reflectance spectra values to be converted to SSA
	wguess = an initialisation value for the optimisation of the SSA/w being calculated
	
X and Rc will be vectors, doesn't matter if they're row or column as long as they're the same

Commands to give:
	wguess = 0.83 (this is just an example value but an initialisation w guess value must be given)
	Import Data = import the reflectance spectra and wavelength vectors
	X = wavelength vector (rename the wavelength vector X)
	Rc = spectrum vector (set Rc to the spectrum to be converted)
	Ensure the inc and emi values within both the above scripts and functions are correct and the same
