# hapke_ssa_matlab
This repository contains Matlab codes used to convert VNIR reflectance spectra to single scattering albedo following a simplified version of the Hapke model. These codes were used to generate the results detailed in Harris, J.K. and M. Grindrod, P. (2018), Hapke mixture modeling applied to VNIR spectra of mafic mineral mixtures and shergottites: Implications for quantitative analysis of satellite data. Meteorit Planet Sci, 53: 1179-1206. https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.13065. Please see this open access paper for explanations of the afore-mentioned simplifications to the Hapke model contained in these codes.

This is an archival repository with no on-going maintanence. If you do pull this code and find it useful please cite this repository and myself in any work you do, and please consider creating your own repository to share any significant updates you may make to the code.

This code was based on previous code written by Elizabeth Sklute (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8980-3798)
